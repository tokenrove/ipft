This cool idea was conceived by Jamie Gamble <bit@distorted.wiw.org>,
who wrote a paper on it.

The implementation was done by Julian Squires <tek@wiw.org> after reading
a pre-release version of this paper.

Some notes:

I would like to implement sizing the buffer using path MTU discovery.
I suppose that will occur soon enough.

The current code is somewhat fragile -- data loss could occur if
values are arbitrarily fucked with or if the MTU along the path
suddenly changes.

Randomly generated and changing frag values, IDs, whatever, would
be nice (based on a pre-established seed, perhaps).
