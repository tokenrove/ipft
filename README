This is some ancient code I dug up.  I know there was a later version
substantially cleaned up, which included OpenBSD support, but I have
been unable to locate a backup of the CVS repository which contained
it.

I'm hoping that putting this up now will encourage me to find that
backup, or at least do something interesting with this code.  I have
no idea if it actually works in any non-trivial sense; no warranties,
et cetera.  It's GPL'd; see the file COPYING for the license text.


The original README (circa 2001) follows:
-----------------------------------------

This cool idea was conceived by Jamie Gamble <bit@distorted.wiw.org>,
who wrote a paper on it.

The implementation was done by Julian Squires <tek@wiw.org> after reading
a pre-release version of this paper.

Some notes:

I would like to implement sizing the buffer using path MTU discovery.
I suppose that will occur soon enough.

The current code is somewhat fragile -- data loss could occur if
values are arbitrarily fucked with or if the MTU along the path
suddenly changes.

Randomly generated and changing frag values, IDs, whatever, would
be nice (based on a pre-established seed, perhaps).
